\arguments{
\item{fasta_tibble}{Output from convert_seq_list_to_tibble}

\item{taxa}{List of desired or undesired taxa}

\item{exclude_taxa}{Determines if you wish to only include or exclude the taxa in 'taxa'}

\item{sites}{List of desired positions in the fasta sequence}

\item{exclude_sites}{Determines if you wish to only include or exclude the sites in 'sites'}

\item{color_palette}{The palette you wish to use. Options are "random", "dna", "rna", "custom", "free", "ocean", "fire", "forest" and "floral".}

\item{custom_colors}{A string of the colors you wish to have in the palette that contains the same amount of colors as unique protein/nucleotide identifiers you have in your data. The first identifier in uniques will be assigned the first color in custom_colors and so on.}

\item{taxon_labels}{Determines if you would like rows to be labeled by their respective taxon}

\item{legend_title}{A String of what you want the legend title to be}

\item{graph_title}{A String of what you want the graph title to be}
